ImdbCrawler
===========

To crawl ratings from IMDB(http://www.imdb.com/).

Although there are some public datasets from recommendation research. 
Such as netflix and movielens. But they are too old for us to use now. 
IMDB is a professional website for people to share their comments and 
rating about the movies they have watched. So it will be helpful to 
our research if we can take advantage of the data on IMDB. Please 
don't use the data for business.

You can run the code easily following:
1. Since the code is written by python, you should install python at 
the first place.
2. Install mongodb in your machine and start the service.
3. Modify the configration file(conf.py) if necessary.
4. Run the crawler in command line:
    >>>>python crawler.py
