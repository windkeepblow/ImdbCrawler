ImdbCrawler
===========

To crawl ratings from IMDB(http://www.imdb.com/).

Although there are some public datasets from recommendation research. 
Such as netflix and movielens. But they are too old for us to use now. 
IMDB is a professional website for people to share their comments and 
rating about the movies they have been watch. So it will be helpful 
to our research if we can take advantage of the data on IMDB. Please 
don't use the data for business.
